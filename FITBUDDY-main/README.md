# FitBuddy

AI-powered health tracker for Android with region-aware diets and daily routines. Log meals and workouts with a photo or loose text; an LLM estimates calories and macros. Includes dashboards, progress charts, editable meal review, and reusable food presets.

## Download

Pre-built APKs and AABs are also attached to [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/anantdark/FitBuddy/releases). Every push to `main` (including merged PRs) publishes a new build tagged `v{versionName}-build{N}`. Release APKs are **arm64-v8a only**. Update checks open the APK download in the system browser (no in-app installer).

FitBuddy is on [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.anant.fitbuddy/) and [OpenAPK](https://www.openapk.net/fitbuddy/com.anant.fitbuddy/) — same codebase and commit as GitHub Releases, built with the `fdroid` product flavor instead of `github`. F-Droid owns updates for that build; it's signed with a different key from the GitHub Releases APK, so the two aren't interchangeable updates for the same install.

## AI providers

Configure at runtime in **Settings** (stored locally via DataStore):

| Provider | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| **OpenRouter** | Free vision models via model dropdown; optional account sign-in |
| **Gemini** | Google AI Studio key; OpenAI-compatible endpoint |
| **OpenAI** | Direct API key; curated gpt-4o catalog |
| **Ollama / compatible** | Local or cloud; any OpenAI-compatible host (LM Studio, vLLM, LocalAI); optional API key |

First-run defaults can be seeded from `local.properties` (see below). Without a key, the app uses the offline simulator.

## Crash reporting

Anonymous crashes go to [Sentry](https://sentry.io) using a DSN committed obfuscated in `app/build.gradle.kts`. No meals, photos, or API keys are sent. Users can opt out under **Settings → Crash reports** and copy a **Support ID** when messaging you — search that id in Sentry to find their events.

With reporting on, the app may send one anonymous **daily heartbeat** the first time it opens each UTC day:

- **Crons** — check-in on monitor `fitbuddy-daily-heartbeat`
- **Explore → Metrics** — counter `fitbuddy.daily_active` (sum; group by `model` / `app_version` / `manufacturer`)
- **Explore → Logs** — message “FitBuddy daily heartbeat” with the same device/app/AI attributes (filter `heartbeat:true`)

Does **not** create Issues. No meals, photos, or API keys.

## Build from source

### Requirements

- JDK 21
- Android SDK with API 36.1 (compile) / API 29+ (min)
- macOS/Linux/WSL (Gradle wrapper included)

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anantdark/FitBuddy.git
cd FitBuddy

# SDK path + optional AI defaults (never commit this file)
cp local.properties.example local.properties
# Edit local.properties — set sdk.dir and optional API keys
```

### Compile & test

```bash
export JAVA_HOME=/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@21/libexec/openjdk.jdk/Contents/Home  # macOS Homebrew

./gradlew :app:compileDebugKotlin
./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest
```

### Install release build (dev)

Release builds use R8 minify + resource shrink. Local `keystore.properties` should point at a
**local/dev** keystore (see [DISTRIBUTION.md](DISTRIBUTION.md)) — not the CI/Play release key.
Without `keystore.properties`, release falls back to the Android debug key:

```bash
./gradlew :app:assembleRelease
# --user 0 = personal profile only (avoids installing into a work profile)
adb install -r --user 0 app/build/outputs/apk/release/FitBuddy-3.0.0-dev.apk
```

CI release signing uses GitHub `RELEASE_*` secrets only. For Play Store setup, see [DISTRIBUTION.md](DISTRIBUTION.md).

## CI / CD

| Workflow | Trigger | What it does |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| [CI](.github/workflows/ci.yml) | Push & PR to `main` | Compile debug/release, run unit tests |
| [Release](.github/workflows/release.yml) | Push to `main` | Build signed APK + AAB, publish GitHub Release (latest) |
| [F-Droid Release](.github/workflows/fdroid-release.yml) | Manual dispatch | Bump version, tag, build fdroid flavor, publish prerelease |

### Releasing

The GitHub release triggers automatically on every push to `main` (including merged PRs). Version is `3.2.<run_number % 100>`.

The F-Droid release is triggered manually from **Actions → F-Droid Release → Run workflow**. You provide the `major.minor` version (e.g. `3.2`), and the patch is computed as `run_number % 100`. The workflow auto-bumps `build.gradle.kts`, commits, tags, builds, and publishes. See [FDROID.md](FDROID.md) for the full process.

See [FDROID.md](FDROID.md) for the full F-Droid process.

### Required: signed release builds in CI

Release workflow **fails** without these [repository secrets](https://github.com/anantdark/FitBuddy/settings/secrets/actions)
(so every APK shares one signing key and browser-based updates can install over the previous release):

| Secret | Value |
|--------|-------|
| `RELEASE_KEYSTORE_BASE64` | Base64-encoded `.jks` file (`base64 -i fitbuddy-release.jks \| pbcopy`) |
| `RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD` | Keystore password |
| `RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS` | Key alias (default: `fitbuddy`) |
| `RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD` | Key password |

See [DISTRIBUTION.md](DISTRIBUTION.md) to create the keystore. After the first release signed
with a new keystore, uninstall any older install once, then install that APK — later
updates over that install will succeed.

## Contributing

1. Fork and create a feature branch
2. Run `./gradlew :app:compileDebugKotlin :app:testDebugUnitTest`
3. Open a PR against `main` — CI must pass
